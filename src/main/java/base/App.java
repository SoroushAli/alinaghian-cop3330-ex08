Example Output

How many people? 8
How many pizzas do you have? 2
How many slices per pizza? 8
8 people with 2 pizzas (16 slices)
Each person gets 2 pieces of pizza.
There are 0 leftover pieces.

Challenges
Revise the program to ensure that inputs are entered as numeric values. Donâ€™t allow the user to proceed if the value entered is not numeric.
Alter the output so it handles pluralization properly, for example: "Each person gets 2 pieces of pizza." or "Each person gets 1 piece of pizza." Handle the output for leftover pieces appropriately as well.
Create a variant of the program that prompts for the number of people and the number of pieces each person wants, and calculate how many full pizzas you need to purchase.
